#Copy Files

Copies files to a target folder.

###Usage Tips
  - If the target folder does not exist, it will be created.
  - The input results must be file types and cannot include ArcGIS geodatabase datasets such as feature classes. However, a file geodatabase (.gdb) can be copied.
  - When copying Shapefiles, all supporting files such as .shp, .dbf, .shx, etc., are copied.
  - When copying Smart Data Compression files, all supporting files such as .sdc, .sdi, etc., are copied.
  - By default, a file's directory structure is maintained when copied.
