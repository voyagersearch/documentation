#Replace Data Source

Replaces an old data source for selected layer files and map document layers with a new data source. Unlike Replace Workspace Path, this task can be used to change the workspace path, workspace type, and / or change the dataset name.

###Usage Tips
  - The input search results must be layer files or map documents.
  - By default, back ups are created. Backups are created in the source location with a .bak extension. **RECOMMENDED**
  - The data source will only be updated if the new data source path is a valid.
  - A data source is the full catalog path to the dataset.

###Screen Captures
