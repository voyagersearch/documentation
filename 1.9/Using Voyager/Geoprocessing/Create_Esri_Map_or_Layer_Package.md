#Create an Esri Map or Layer Package

Package selected search results into a single compressed file (.mpk or .lpk).

###Usage Tips
  - A processing extent can be specified to limit the geographic area being packaged.
  - If no processing extent is specified, the full extent of inputs is used.
  - The projection is used to project the output results. The default is WGS84.
  - The package file can be downloaded and opened directly in ArcMap.
  - The output data for layer and map packages is a file geodatabase.
  - Non-spatial files such as text files, PDF, and Office documents will be included in the package.
  - Although optional, it's recommended to provide a summary and tags as this will make searching for the package easier.
  - Tags can be separated using commas or semi-colons.
